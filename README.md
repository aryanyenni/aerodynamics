# Aerodynamics-Simulations
This repository holds simulation-based aerodynamics projects using fluids and aerodynamics principles learned in 16.101x Intro to Aerodynamics.
The projects utilize a multitude of skills and softwares, such as CAD, computational fluid dynamics, analysis with MATLAB, and other project-specific skills.

## Objectives
- build simulations to understand airfoil behavior within fluids
- observe different outputs depending on airfoil geometry and angles of attack
- explore a variety of softwares that come together for simulation-based projects
- learn enough about fluids and aerodynamics for technical interviews

## Projects
**[NACA Airfoil CFD Study](./Project1_NACA_Airfoil_CFD)**
Onshape + SimScale + MATLAB analysis of lift and drag over angles of attack
