# Project1: NACA Airfoil CFD Study
This project explores the aerodynamic performance of NACA airfoils using CFD simulations and post-processing tools. It is the first in a series of simulation-based aerodynamics studies.

While completely independent and self-directed, the project draws on core aerodynamic concepts learned through the 16.101x Intro to Aerodynamics. The goal is to understand how global forces and local stresses behave with different airfoil shapes and orientations.


## Objectives
- simulate 2D incompressible, subsonic airflow over NACA airfoils
- vary the angle of attack to extract aerodynamic coefficients
- post-process and plot results using MATLAB
- analyze global body forces and local surface stresses
- document methodology, findings, and analysis in a lab-style report

## Files
- 'Aerodynamic Analysis of NACA Airfoils Using CFD and MATLAB.pdf' - the lab-style report
- some matlab script
- some cad files
- some simulation file(s)
